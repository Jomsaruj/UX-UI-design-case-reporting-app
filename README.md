### Background

First and foremost, the research topic for this lab is  â€œHow do people discover what document or information they need to prepare before going to report a particular case at the police station" Since the COVID-19 pandemic is still going on, we do not want to be in a crowded place for too long. Therefore, I am working on an application that aims to help people discover what documents they need to prepare. So, they can finish their business as fast as possible. This research finding will help guide an application design.
